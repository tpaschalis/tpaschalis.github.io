There have been a LOT of articles in the internet about the rise of Airbnb, and the subsequent effects in touristic areas. Am I too late to the party? I'd like to tell my own personal experience, and use some data to see what's going on.

But let's look a while back, first.
About six years ago, I came to Thessaloniki to start my undergraduate studies in Physics. As a pennyless 18-year-old, I applied for university housing and was excited to find out that I had been accepted in the dormitories! My very own space! Seven *whole* square meters!

The same month, my girlfriend, Anna, arrived in Thessaloniki for the same purpose. She searched, and found an apartment to rent, in a quite, suburban neighborhood.

Fast forward two years, and due to some economic problems, Anna had to move. We searched together and found another apartment, a little closer to the city center. 

Back to present! We're loo
