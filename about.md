Hey! I'm Paschalis a 26 y/o SWE from Greece.

I'm a Physics graduate, with experience in various roles, in both academia and the industry.    
I have experimented with a wide array of modern and not-so-modern technologies, am a `vi` person, prefer to work with Python and Go, and generally try to adhere to the KISS principle. <sup><sub>most problems can be easily solved using grep/sed/awk/pipes, cmv</sub></sup>

### More Information

### Projects
I'm pretty sure I'm forgetting things, but here are some weekend projects I've worked on, outside of my main job.

* [goof](https://github.com/tpaschalis/goof) is *the easiest* way to send and receive files over a network.  
* [tweetstream.space](http://tweetstream.space/) allows indexing tweets in specific timeframes.
* [go-tinyraytracer](https://github.com/tpaschalis/go-tinyraytracer) is a ray tracer in Go.    
It was surprisingly easy and a lot of fun, that's why I also coded a [ray-marcher](https://github.com/tpaschalis/go-tinykaboom) and also building a [renderer](https://github.com/tpaschalis/go-tinyrenderer) in Go. Check out *all of* [ssloy's](https://github.com/ssloy) work if you're interested in this kind of stuff, no previous knowledge needed.
* [shell-utils](https://github.com/tpaschalis/shell-utils) is an embarassingly small collection of shell scripts that provide day-to-day quality of life, that I'm planning to extend a lot.
* [bashercises.co](http://bashercises.co/) is a dead simple Markdown/Jenkins/Hugo/S3 project. Last year I've been working with shell scripting **a lot**, and I'm planning to distill all my notes into complete cheatsheets and provide exercises to beginners, so they can master the console way of doing things.
* (to be filled out with more stuff as they're polished).
