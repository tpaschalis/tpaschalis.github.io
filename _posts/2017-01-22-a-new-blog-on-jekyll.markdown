## Who is this?

Hi! I'm Paschalis, an aspiring young physicist from Greece.  
I'm currently wrapping up my undergraduate studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (AUTh), and will begin a postgraduate program later in 2017. The focus of my efforts as an undergrad was towards Computational and Applied Physics, where I had the opportunity to get involved in various projects, meet and work with some of the most respected scientists in the field, [travel to Korea]() and write lots of code.

For the most part of my studies, I have also held a full-time job in the IT sector, mainly in a System's Engineer position, but also in some short-term System Administration and Software Engineering internships.  
I really enjoy creating awesome projects, simulating and solving challenging, complex problems.

## Why start a blog?

My New Year's Resolution for this year was, well, to start a blog. I think it could be a great opportunity to take notes and document my journey of learning new stuff, share things I've been working on, practice my writing skills, as well as a motivation factor to not give up when I run into a wall.

The past year has been really busy and productive, and I hope to be able to showcase some interesting stuff.  

## Why Jekyll?

When I looked around at the possible solutions to host a blog, I found most of the options tedious.  
I really don't need a fully-fledged CMS like WordPress, or mess with a dashboard like Blogger's (and frankly, stepping outside of Google's ecosystem can be refreshing). Most of the options I explored felt too clunky, bloated and overweight for the sole purpose of storing, displaying and styling text.

Jekyll seemed like the perfect choice, as [Piotr Migdal's post](http://p.migdal.pl/2015/12/02/first-post.html) has put it. 

Furthermore,

Jekyll being Open Source is a huge plus.  
GitHub can host Jekyll pages natively, so I can start right away, and figure out the best long-term hosting later on.  
I love the simplicity of static pages. Simple HTML and CSS *can* look gorgeous, are fast, and small.  
I like plaintext, and want to be able to archive, search through, and run this blog as painlessly as possible.  
I use LaTeX almost daily, and want to be able to keep doing so.  
I like Markdown, and can't live without Git.  
When I want advanced or new features like tags or comments, I can simply sit down and code them.  

## How often/what will you post?

I will post about code, physics and my journey through academia, about various projects I have running or will pick up, as well as novel topics I'm learning about.  
I will probaby be spending most of 2017 in a not-so-productive way, as I will be serving in the Greek Army forces (it's compulsory to do so in Greece), and can't know for sure how much free time I will have. A target of ~5-6 good blog posts for this year would make me happy.


## Show me a thing or two!

I will! Soon enough!
