There were no new posts this week; I've been taking advantage of Pluralsight's [free courses](https://www.pluralsight.com/offer/2020/free-april-month), and also doing some first steps to revamp this blog. I've recently come across many superb blogs, and would like to help mine reach a new level!

I'm still contemplating moving to another domain, but for now, I just introduced some new pages you can find at the top.

- The [Open-Source](https://tpaschalis.github.io/opensource/) page lists some of my open-source contributions. I was especially proud to get a small change accepted into the Go language, and I hope to keep this momentum throughout 2020
- The [Reading](https://tpaschalis.github.io/reading/) page contains every book and paper I've read since early 2019, along with small comments
- The [Now](https://tpaschalis.github.io/now) page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff), is a public priority list, which will hopefully help me stay the course and maintain consistency

As a second step, I want to practice by editing some older posts and maybe delete some superficial ones.

Until next time!
