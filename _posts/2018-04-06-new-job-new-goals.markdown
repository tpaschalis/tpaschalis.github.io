When 2018 came in, I re-stumbled upon this quote by [Jeff Atwood](https://blog.codinghorror.com/10-years-of-coding-horror/). 
> One of my philosophies is to always pick the choice that scares you a little. The status quo, the path of least resistance, the everyday routine â€” that stuff is easy. Anyone can do that. But the right decisions, the decisions that challenge you, the ones that push you to evolve and grow and learn, are always a little scary.

Then, in late February, I encountered an opportunity, to make such a choice, and grabbed it by the forelock. I am really excited for that change, and I wanted to share the news!

As of early March, I am proud to be a part of the awesome [Sigmia](http://www.sigmia.com) team in a *Software Engineer* capacity. 

As I'm going through the Onboarding process, I've notice a couple of things.   

First off, stepping in such a drastically different enironment, in fact a whole different industry, I felt a breath of fresh air. So many new, shiny things to explore, knowledge to gain, questions to ask!   
Secondly, I'm eager to *get my hands dirty* with as much stuff as possible, and try to identify and solve problems. I'm lucky that there's a supportive environment that encouarges to use the newcomer's perspective, in order to innovate, and a Team Lead that says *"Question Everything and Anything"*..! 

I plan to consciously work on keeping this fresh perspective for as long as possible, before routine settles in!

I would like to thank both the people that helped me get to where I am now, as well as the welcoming Sigmia team.

Let's do this!
