## Who is this?

Hey! It's still Paschalis, now a *graduate* physicist, that is now working towards an MSc in Computational Physics, loves to build and break stuff, as well as learn about something new (nearly) every day! ^^

Exactly one year ago, I started this blog. During this time, it has grown into something that I actually *care* about, a personal space that I enjoy fiddling around with, and that I can be proud of at least one or two things that are hosted here.

## What happened here during the past 365 days?
- A total of 11 new articles/posts/nodes were created.
- A barebones `tags` system was implemented (you can use ctrl+F).
- A major overhaul took place, largely based on [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now), but skinnied down a lot. 
- URL scheme changed to something friendlier.
- I actually showed this blog to people IRL and on HackerNews, and got real-world feedback.
- I thought setting up Jekyll on my own VPS, decided against it. For now GitHub pages (<3) provide stable and hassle free hosting.

The truth is, I didn't post any earth-shattering knowledge or, Red Sea parting advice on `How to use AI Blockchain Technology to Cure Dermatitis`, or `Implement the Random Forest Algorithm to Save the Bees`. But I sincerely tried to write about things I encountered in my everyday work, in a coherent sensible way that might benefit a random person on the internet. And that would be enough for me personally.

Looking back to the very first post, I see
> My New Year's Resolution for this year was, well, to start a blog. I think it could be a great opportunity to take notes and document my journey of learning new stuff, share things I've been working on, practice my writing skills, as well as a motivation factor to not give up when I run into a wall.   

> I really don't need a fully-fledged CMS [...]  Most of the options I explored felt too bloated [...] for the sole purpose of storing, displaying and styling text. [...] Jekyll seemed like the perfect choice.   

> A target of ~5-6 good blog posts for this year would make me happy.   


And that's what really happened. I learned more about Jekyll, and [blogging like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html). I used Git to monitor my train of thought and gamify the advancement of projects. I implemented features I needed. I pushed myself to document solutions to my own problems, and motivate myself to polish them. I threw out (or just kept in the drawer) *a lot* of sub-par drafts of posts, and forced myself to take conscious steps towards becoming a better writer. I don't know if I do have 5-6 good blog posts, but again, I'd say I have one or two that personally, I'm proud of.


Also, I started noticing how other people set up their own blogs and personal webpages, CVs and Portfolios. That provided a scale of measurement and goals to reach. I found tiny corners of the internet that you wouldn't end up to, unless you Googled for very specific keywords in quotes. I found really smart and interesting people that inspired me and lit new ideas. 

It sometimes felt like the internet of the early 2000, *where you went to places, and not to the mall.*

## What's next? What's not?

Plans for 2018 include
- A proper comment section, or at least a "Discuss on Twitter/Send me an e-mail" button.
- Introduction of "Software in Physics" and "Data Analysis" posts.
- More of "What I Learned From" style posts.
- Polishing and refinement of old drafts.
- Presenting the two side projects I'm working on.


For this whole past year, I haven't had any analytics, except for the traffic surge that one of my side projects received [when I submitted it on Hacker News](https://tpaschalis.github.io/tweetstreamspace-was-on-hn/) (just the number of HTTP requests). I would never exchange a potential reader's personal information for pennies, in hope he clicks on an intrusive and/or malicious ad. "But how are you going to get better at blogging? How can you figure out what the audience likes?". Well, as I said, this blog is a personal experiment for me to force myself to write, code, and get better at it. It's not, and is far from being a [Coding Horror](https://blog.codinghorror.com/) style blog. The personal gain in an honest feedback message would *far* outweigh potential clicks.


## Here's a small token of appreciation for anyone reading.

Thanks a lot for taking a moment of your time to be here, instead of "a mall".    
Here's a list of blogs that I visited last year, and might be of interest to you, too!

(Small detail, I do not have a personal opinion on any of the authors, this is not an endorsement, neither have I read *all* of their content. I JUST enjoyed some their content throughout the year, and am happy to share it with y'all). Most of these were through peer recommendations, following internet rabbit holes, or through HN/Reddit. I did not include any company blogs, because they're easier to find.
