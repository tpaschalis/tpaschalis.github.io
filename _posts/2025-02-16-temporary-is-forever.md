There's a greek proverb: "ουδέν μονιμότερον του προσωρινού" that roughly
translates to **nothing persists more than the temporary**.

When Romans built arches two millennia ago, they didn't leave wooden scaffolding
up after laying the stones, but software, is a little different. Empires rise
and fall in the span of months, and temporary often means forever.

* That quick 30-second demo you recorded with wobbly audio? Will be played again
  and again and again in customer meetings, helping close million-dollar deals.
* That one-off installation Bash script you wrote as a PoC? It will run on
  thousands of customer machines, usually as `root`.
* That architectural diagram you sketched on a napkin? Will be repeated in
  slides and conference talks for years to come.
* That [one-off cronjob](https://bsky.app/profile/tpaschalis.me/post/3li7qycom3c25)?
  Will quietly run for more than half a decade with no complaints.

I'm not defending the practice, but the realization is that priorities change a
lot, and oftentimes, 80% of the way is deemed enough — or at least the remaining
20% will unfortunately never be prioritized.

So, what can you do about it? This is not yet another post complaining about
tech debt, trying to be a purist, or mocking development practices, _but_ it
goes hand-in-hand with one of my core philosophies that _caring, even a tiny
little bit, is a superpower_.

Next time there's pressure to deliver a quick "temporary" solution, go for a
walk, make a fresh cup of coffee and spend 10% extra time on that task before
you `git push.`

Nobody's gonna bat an eye at that 'delay'. You might find an opportunity to
automate the demo for others to run, test out a new linter, smirk at what the
flavor-of-the-month LLM has to say or write a kickass docstring that will be
read by other engineers for years onwards. But more likely than not, it will be
time well spent on that ~~temporary~~ solution.
