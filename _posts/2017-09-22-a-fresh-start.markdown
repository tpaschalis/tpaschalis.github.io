description: "A fresh start!"  
---

Well, September came by faster than I thought it would.  

In the last six months, a lot has happened. Basically, the past week was the end-stage for so many things in life, it's been overwhelming, in the good sense ^^  
The mandatory military service is over, and after six whole months I'm not 'offline'..! (by the way, so many more countries than I thought have some form of conscription),  
I got my Physics degree,  
I'm starting my postgrad studies,  
aaaaand I'm neck deep in responsibilities as well as new, exciting projects and ideas.

I feel relieved that in 2017 I managed to wrap things up, move one step forward, as well as be done with responsibilities that could halt my progress.
I have so many people to thank for their support and guidance, my family, my girlfriend, friends, professors, and I hope to make it up to them.

The thing I've been wanting to change the most is this sad diagram haha.

So what now? A new, fresh start is in order as the academic year begins.
First of all, I'm excited that classes are starting, and searching for the right Thesis project. 
Also I'm looking forward for some SysAdmin-related side-project, and to cleaning up some blogposts I've been meaning to share. 
It might be a good time to catch up to the local tech and meetups scene, as well as brush up on my public speaking skills.  
Finally, it seems that I have to revamp this blog (seriously, is it even a blog if it doesn't have a comments section?!)
