Sliding window problems.

## Intro 

Let's talk through some of the logic behind problems that can be solved using the sliding window technique. After understanding and being able to identify problems that can be solved using this paradigm, you can solve any number of them!

## Dead Giveaways
Some identifying characteristic of such problems :

## It's a form of dynamic programming
different than memoization or tabulation
O(1) space

## The very basics

At its most basic form, we need to have a *window* with two pointers indicating where the window begins and where it ends.
We usually also keep track of the previous optimal solution.

This windows can perform two kinds of actions, grow/shrink and slide left/right.

Fast/Slow
Fast/Catchup
Fast/Lagging (Fast/Trailing)
Front/Back
