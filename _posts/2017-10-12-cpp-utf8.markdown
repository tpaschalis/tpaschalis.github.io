About two months ago, I met a friend for a coffee to catch up on various stuff. (Hi Giannis!)  
In some point he mentioned an application he'd been developing, and had run into an unexpected issue. He had been using C++ to manage a database, with contents encoded in UTF8 (greek characters). 

The code worked just fine in Linux, but failed in the client's Windows systems. Instead of displaying and using greek text properly, some `Ìðïñþ íá ãñÜøù åëëçíéêïýò ÷áñáêôÞñ` mumbo-jumbo appeared. As it happens in the real-world you can't just change the client's infrastructure to Linux or just install another C++ version, so he asked me to take a look, so I hacked something fast.

[Here's the code](https://github.com/tpaschalis/cpp-utf8-io), as a complete example, tested on MS Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition. (I hope GitHub handles UTF8 text). 

Well, here's the main lines that make it work

```cpp
#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

#include <codecvt>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <io.h>

...
...
...

	// Write file in UTF-8
	std::wofstream wof;
	wof.imbue(std::locale(std::locale::empty(), new std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t, 0x10ffff, std::generate_header>));
	wof.open(L"example.txt");
	wof << L"This is a test. \n";
	wof << L"Μπορώ να γράψω ελληνικούς χαρακτήρες \n";
	wof << L"Ακόμα μια δοκιμή;;;;!!11?1 \n";
	wof.close();

...
...
...

	// Read file in UTF-8
	std::ifstream f("utf8text.txt");
	std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(f.rdbuf());
	std::wistream wf(&conv);

#ifdef _WIN32
	_setmode(_fileno(stdout), _O_WTEXT);
#else
	std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "");
#endif 
	for (wchar_t c; wf.get(c); )
		std::wcout << c ;
```
