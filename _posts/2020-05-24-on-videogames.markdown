Videogames have been an enormous part of my life.

I've played for fun, to learn how computers work, to socialize with friends, to break through a minor depression patch, to escape into a different world, or to create one from scratch.

And I'll probably keep being a part of this wonderful world for many, many years to come.

I've gone through a lot of phases, some healthy and some not so much. I've gone *deeep* into the rabbit hole, then stopped playing for years at a time saying *this is a waste of time*, then jump in maniacally for some weeks, and abstaining again.

But for the most part this past year, I've been playing for another reason.

Do you know the feeling where you just ironed out a really tough bug at work? Where you used your skills, your wits and grit to bend the machine to your will? Well, it's an awesome feeling, right? Personally, it's *what keeps me going* and at times, it's just possible that you can't get it from work, side projects, or your other hobbies.

Videogames are a quick way of *getting my mojo back*. Having an hour or two to just yourself, emptying out your mind just to clear that boss fight, or record the perfect lap time is like meditation to me. 

That's why I've been trying to Platinum Bloodborne or doing 100+ laps of the Monaco Grand Prix.

Practicing the same thing over and over again, with little distraction, is as calming as woodworking or sewing is to other people.

All in all, I'm happy I've found a new balance in this hobby; after all, that philosopher said, "all in good measure".
