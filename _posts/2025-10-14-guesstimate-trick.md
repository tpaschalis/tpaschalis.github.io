So one thing that I hate is when people refuse to give out estimates. I'm not
talking about complex [Fermi
questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem), but run-of-the-mill
every day questions like:

* How long does this medicine usually takes to act?
* How much does it cost to fix my car's A/C?
* How flexible would the landlord be in negotiating rent?
* How much work does a new feature need in our frontend?

Many times, there's a good reason for that. Maybe they _really_ don't know. Or
they don't want to commit to something because they're afraid you (or someone
else) will try to hold them accountable for their answer. Maybe it _is_
complicated and really _it depends_, or they just don't want to deal with pesky
me asking more questions than needed.

But thing is I _do_ want to know. I want to know, even though it's not gonna be
a perfect estimate, but it helps me mentally know at least what I'm looking at.
Even a semi-random guesstimate would be enough in many cases.

So far I've got a trick that I think works; it works on my car mechanic, it
works on our pediatrician, it works on predatory real estate agents. I call it
"the three orders of magnitude".

## Ok, so what do I do?

First off, you tell the other person that you're _just curious_; you won't hold
them to their answer, it's not final, you just want a gut reaction, it's not
the end of the world, who cares yadda yadda.

_Then_, you present two values in a range, that _both_ sounds implausibly
silly; two, or more often three orders of magnitude apart:

* So will the bump go away in 5 minutes or 5 days?
* So is this 1 day or 1 quarter worth of work?
* So will materials cost $20 or $20k?

Often the answer is "Pfft are you crazy? $20 doesn't get you an ice-cream and
$20k gets you a new car. I'd say somewhere around $300 and we'll fix the old
A/C".

The goal is to make the other person scoff at both ends of the range, but in a
way that they can't "just" choose the middle of it to weasel out of giving an
answer.

## Outro

So, how are you gonna use it? Just this once, a thousand times in your
lifetime? What'd you say?

Until next time, bye!
