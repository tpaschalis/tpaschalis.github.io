I've been cutting my teeth on a K8S stack. That means *a lot* of YAML. 

After some time, there are two things I recommend if you're working with Vim. 

First off, add the following magic line to your .vimrc 
```
autocmd FileType yaml setlocal ts=2 sts=2 sw=2 expandtab indentkeys-=0# indentkeys-=<:> foldmethod=indent nofoldenable
```

In english, this [autocommand](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/autocmd.html) will enable Vim to apply a couple of rules to YAML files
* Skip re-indenting lines after a comment `#`, after a colon `:` or at the beginning of a line. 
* `ts (tabstop)` a &lt;Tab&gt; key will count as two spaces  
* `sw (shiftwidth)` identation and auto-identation will use two spaces (eg. when using `>>` or `gg=G`)
* `sts (softtabstop)` a &lt;Tab&gt; will count for two spaces when expanding tabs (inserting a tab, or using the Backspace key)   
* `expandttab` use spaces instead of tabs
* `foldmethod` folding will be based on indentation levels
* `nofoldenable` the file will be opened without any folds

You might want to take a look at the [Folding](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Folding) page of the Vim wiki. In short, if your cursor is inside a fold-able section, use `zc` to *c*lose a fold, `zo` to *o*pen one, and `za` to toggle/*a*lternate the current fold. Alternatively, use `zM` to close or `zR` to open all folds throughout the file.


Secondly, you could also use mrk21's [yaml-vim](https://github.com/mrk21/yaml-vim) plugin. It will enable syntax highlighting, and set indentation settings on its own.
Since Vim v8, there's native [support](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it) for packages, so you can even avoid using a package manager and just 
```
git clone git@github.com:mrk21/yaml-vim.git ~/.vim/pack/plugins/yaml-vim
```

Oh, and since last post, I've joined [Beat](https://thebeat.co) as a Backend Engineer; I'm more pumped than I've been in a long time! : )   
But I think this deserves another post of its own <sup><sub>(soon)</sub></sup>.
