Tomorrow is my last day at [Sigmia](http://www.sigmia.com/).

I'd like to say a warm *thank you* to everyone I've worked with during this past year and a half. You provided with opportunities to watch, learn, and contribute to ambitious projects. You've built an awesome work environment I was proud to belong in and really helped me grow as a person and as a professional. 

I witnessed first-hand the great things a strong [two-pizza team](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/24/the-two-pizza-rule-and-the-secret-of-amazons-success) can achieve, and will always look back at this point in my career with a smile. : )

I wish you all the best for the future. I'm sure you're going to achieve great things, so keep up the momentum. Also, don't forget to reach out every now and then!

Your friend,   
Paschalis
