In a week that was mostly ðŸ¤® (hey can I render emoji hereâ€½), I noticed that this little blog is now a 'featured snippet' on Google's search result! (or at least was for a time, future readers)

I digging information for another "Go internals" post and was checking if any new sources have popped up; I was presented with this screen.

</center>

This, let's be honest, absolutely insignificant thing was the week's 'spark' for me; a small positive thought, feedback, or factoid that put me right back on track.

So, a personal reminder, next time I'm feeling disillusioned, I'll try to look around for that 'spark'; to reminisce of past achievements, remember why I love coding and technology, help other people, or just disconnect and take a long walk in a nearby grove. Also, don't miss the chance to be that 'spark for other people. You'll both be glad for it.

I'm off to play around with Nix, see you soon!
