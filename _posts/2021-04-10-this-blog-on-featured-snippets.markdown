In a week that was mostly ðŸ¤® (hey can I render emoji hereâ€½), I noticed that this little blog is now (or at least was for a time, future readers) a 'featured snippet' on Google's search result!

I was looking for some information for another "Go internals" blogpost I'm writing to see if any new sources have popped up, but was presented with this screen.

<img src="/images/featured-snippet.png" style='height: 80%; width: 80%; object-fit: contain'/>

This, let's be honest, absolutely insignificant thing was the week's 'spark' for me; a small positive thought, feedback, or factoid that can put you back on track.

So, a personal reminder, next time I'm feeling disillusioned, I'll try to look around for that 'spark'; to reminisce of past achievements, remember why I love coding and technology, help other people, or just disconnect and take a long walk in a nearby grove. Also, don't miss the chance to be that 'spark for other people. You'll both be glad for it.

I'm off to play around with Nix, see you soon!
