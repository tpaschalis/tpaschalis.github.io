I used to be an avid book reader. For some years, university education made me *hate reading for fun*, but since graduating I've started enjoying a book again.


Here's a list of books that I’ve read since early 2019, along with tweet-long comments. I've put in **bold** titles that I would highly recommend.   
Hope you can find something interesting here as well!

## 2019

### Technical
* [**Designing Data-Intensive Applications**](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/1449373321) by Martin Kleppmann    
A masterpiece. Whether you're designing distributed systems, want to learn more about how databases work, or are just interested in software, it's a must-read. It's a bit on the *heavy* side, but it tied together so many ideas in a beautiful way.

* [Building Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Microservices-Designing-Fine-Grained-Systems/dp/1491950358) by Sam Newman  
I read it immediately after "Data-Intensive Applications"; the two had some material overlap so I was drawing comparisons. Honestly, it was a bit scrappy, overall *meh*. I didn't enjoy the style, but still conveyed some cool ideas in an approachable way.

* [The Go Programming Language](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440) by Alan A. A. Donovan, Brian W. Kernighan   

* [The Mythical Man-Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959) by Frederick Brooks  
I've lost count of how many times I've seen people recommend "The Mythical Man-Month". I borrowed it from a friendly library, and blasted through it during the January vacation. It indeed is "*the* classic book on the human elements of software engineering".

* [Cracking the Code Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) by Gayle Laakmann McDowell   


* [The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master-ebook/dp/B003GCTQAE)   

* [Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days](https://www.amazon.com/Sprint-Solve-Problems-Test-Ideas-ebook/dp/B010MH1DAQ)

### Non-Technical Books
* [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Three-Body-Problem-Cixin-Liu/dp/0765382032) by Cixin Liu  
If possible, go through it without being spoiled (don't even read the back cover). I enjoyed the original translation as it was able to maintain a lot of exotic elements of the author's native chinese and didn't read like "just a book in English".

* [So Good They Can't Ignore You](https://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-You/dp/1455509124) by Cal Newport   
This book changed the way I see my career, and software engineering in general. It helped me create a mental path of who I want to become, and how to achieve the goal to hone my craft and become an *expert software engineer* (it's a long conversation). 

* [Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility](https://www.amazon.com/Powerful-Building-Culture-Freedom-Responsibility/dp/1939714095) by Patty McCord  

* [L’Étranger (The Stranger)](https://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Albert-Camus/dp/0679720200) by Albert Camus.   
A small book I read during a car trip. It put me in thoughts and provided hours of conversations. What more could I ask for?
