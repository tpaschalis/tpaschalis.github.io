This is a [now](https://nownownow.com/about) page, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/nowff).

It's a simple page, serving as a public declaration of priorities, helping me keep focus on what's important for me right now.

You can browse some great now pages and blogs from [nownownow.com](https://nownownow.com/)

## What I'm doing right now
- I'm working as a Software Engineer for [Grafana Labs](https://grafana.com/)
- Building a path for my long-term career goal of becoming a _great_ software engineer (for any definition of that term)
- I'm trying to give back to the open source community by [contributing](https://tpaschalis.github.io/opensource/) to different projects
- I'm interested in developing a deeper understanding for Distributed Systems and performance engineering
- I'm working towards building the skill set and understanding of a more Senior engineer; that includes both soft skills, team/organization dynamics, systems thinking and that elusive higher level vision and 'common sense' that transcends specific tech stacks
