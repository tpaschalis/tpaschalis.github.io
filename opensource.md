### Grafana

OSS is in our DNA -- and it's not just a catchphrase, it's a reality. 90% of my work at Grafana Labs is out there in the open

### beatlabs/patron

Patron was the FOSS microservices framework that powered Beat's (nowadays FreeNow) entire ecosystem, literally 60+ microservices in Go. 

I served in the maintainer team, in an attempt to improve tooling for every single team throughout the company. While it's a thing of the past, it was my first _real_ case of designing and developing things out there in the open, so I owe [@mantzas](https://github.com/mantzas) a great deal for his trust and support back when I was starting at Beat.
